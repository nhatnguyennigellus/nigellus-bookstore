		<h2>TERM & CONDITION</h2>
<p>		These terms and conditions apply to the use of
		the Good Books website and the goods available through it, which are
		supplied by Paperbackshop UK (PBS). In using our website or purchasing
		goods from our distributor PBS, you agree to be bound by these terms
		and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions,
		please do not use this website or purchase goods through PBS.
</p>
		<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> The information and goods provided through this website
		are provided for the benefit of users in good faith and with
		reasonable care. Despite our best efforts it may be possible that
		errors and omissions in information can occur. We would invite
		customers to alert us to any such errors or omissions but cannot
		accept any liability for loss or damage which may directly or
		indirectly result from any opinion, information, advice,
		representation or omission contained on this website, or through any
		linked websites. This disclaimer does not attempt to exclude liability
		in relation to any term implied by law which cannot be lawfully
		excluded. </p>
		
		<p><b>Site content and functionality:</b> We endeavour to keep all
		information on our site both up to date and accurate. However on some
		occasions this is not always possible and we regret that this cannot
		be guaranteed. On rare occasions some of the functionalities of the
		website can be suspended temporarily during maintenance and repair
		operations. We will do our best to ensure that these occasions are as
		brief and infrequent as possible.</p>
		<p><b>Terms and conditions of sale: </b>Good
		Books is a 100% not-for-profit trust of Aotearoa New Zealand,
		registered under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. Our books are
		supplied by the distributor Paperbackshop UK (PBS). When PBS receives
		the details of your order they then e-mail back a confirmation of that
		order, including the payment details. Payments are made to PBS online,
		in a secure purchasing environment, by credit card. Upon receipt of
		payment PBS will forward your book/s and a packing slip. PBS then pays
		a fee to Good Books based on the retail margin applicable to the book
		sold. This structure satisfies the requirements of the local
		Charitable Trusts Act. This model keeps our costs to zero, because all
		our local work is voluntary, our services are pro bono and any
		resources are donated, ensuring maximum benefit to our charitable
		partner, Oxfam.</p>
		<p> At Good Books we are absolutely committed to fair
		business practices. All Good Books website activities come under the
		legal jurisdiction of Aotearoa New Zealand. The Good Books website
		follows the Model Code for Consumer Protection in Electronic Commerce
		and the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993. The acts are both available at:
		http://www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz Good Books also observe our
		obligations as set out by the Fair Trading Act 1986, which can be
		accessed at: http://www.comcom.govt.nz </p><p>Where the provisions of the
		Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 apply, these terms will be read subject
		to the application of that Act, and in the case of any conflict, the
		provisions of that Act will apply. The Consumer Guarantees Act 1993
		does not apply to business customers purchasing products for the
		purposes of a business (where 'business' is as defined by the Act).
		Business customers agree that where products are purchased for the
		purpose of a business that the Act does not apply.</p>
		<p><b>Prices: </b>Prices displayed for books may be subject to change without notice. However,
		prices for items on an order are fixed once an order has been
		accepted. So any subsequent price changes either up or down will not
		be retroactively applied to any accepted orders. The same book can be
		displayed with more than one price. This is because we use a number of
		wholesalers and they have different prices set. Also, price can vary
		due to country of origin.</p>
		<p><b> Order Cancellations: </b>PBS always endeavours
		to supply orders placed and accepted on this website, however, order
		placement and acceptance do not constitute an obligation to supply. In
		spite of the best efforts there may be times when a publisher is
		unable to supply a book, despite having advised PBS that a title was
		in stock. At such times we reserve the right to cancel any order.</p><p> In
		event of any cancelled order, payments that have been processed will
		be refunded in accordance with consumer protection guidelines.</p>
<p>
		Customers who wish to cancel any order must notify Good Books by email
		by 9 am on the next business day following the date of that order.
		However, due to time zone differences sometimes an order may have
		already been processed in this time frame. If this happens we will
		still always refund the order but the book will need to be returned to
		us first. Please contact us for the returns address. 
		
		</p>
		<p><b>Damaged Goods:</b>
		Whenever possible we will ensure the replacement of damaged goods.
		Where replacement of damaged goods is not possible (due to stock
		issues) a full refund will be issued for the value of the damaged
		goods. Damaged goods must be returned in accordance with our Returns &
		Refunds Policy.</p>
		 <p><b>Returns & Refunds Policy: </b>Good Books will always
		accept returns. If you are not happy with the goods you have received
		then please return them to us and we will arrange to have them
		refunded. Please, if you have goods that were damaged or faulty on
		delivery, supplied incorrectly, or goods that vary from the
		description on the website, please do let us know and return them to
		us so we can arrange an immediate refund for you. Our policy is to
		ensure we observe our obligations under the Consumer Guarantees Act
		(1993), and Fair Trading Act (1986) - but most of all we want happy
		customers.</p><p> Please use our online contact form if you wish to enquire
		about returning an order. We will tell you how and where to return
		them.</p> 
		<p><b>Refunds: </b>Any books incorrectly supplied or described may be
		returned for a complete refund. In the unlikely event of non-delivery,
		Good Books will arrange a re-issue or a refund for you.</p>
		<p><b>Delivery: </b> If a product is found to be wrongly addressed by Good Books then Good Books
		shall be fully responsible for the re-delivery, replacement or
		refunding of the product. If the customer is found to have given an
		incorrect or insufficient address, then responsibility for correcting
		delivery may need to be borne by the customer. </p>
		<p><b>Mailing Cash: </b>Good
		Books request that no cash ever be mailed for payment of products. If
		a customer does choose to mail cash, Good Books cannot accept
		responsibility for the theft, loss or otherwise non-delivery of mailed
		cash. Online payments can be made by MasterCard or Visa.</p>
		<p><b>GST:</b>  Books through Good Books come from overseas sources. Books supplied through
		PBS attract no GST when the value of the transaction is less than
		$333.</p>
		<p><b>Registered members' accounts: </b> In using this website you accept
		all responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
		details, including your password. This may involve restricting access

		under your registered account details.</p>

		confirmation email within 24 hours, please complete our online contact
		form. </p>
		<p><b>Children: </b>Some of our products are aimed at children. However,
		these are not available for purchase by children and must only be
		purchased by adults. Persons under the age of 18 may only use this
		site under supervision of their parent or guardian. Our range of books
		provides a wide choice, suitable for many different readers and we try

		children. </p>
