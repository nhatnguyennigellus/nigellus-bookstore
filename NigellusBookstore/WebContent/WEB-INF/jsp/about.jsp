		<h2>ABOUT US</h2><img alt="Nigellus Bookstore" width="120"

		<h4>At Good Books we offer readers a very simple proposition:
			every time you buy from us, 100% of the retail profit goes directly
			to fund projects in partnership with Oxfam.</h4>
		<b>The story behind Good Books</b>
		<p>Rather than fight a system, we wanted to transform it from
			within to constructive effect &#45; so we set up Good Books.</p>
		<p>Good Books is simply about creating positive and enduring
			connections between commercial worlds and wider, less advantaged
			communities. All time, professional services and resources are
			donated. Any profit from any sale goes directly to Oxfam to fund
			projects that provide clean water, sanitation, develop sustainable
			agriculture and create access to education. So as you buy, you are
			actively supporting communities in need.</p>
		<p>No one at Good Books is paid and we have zero operating costs.
			We just love books, and reading, and helping out.</p>

		<h4>Key Partners </h4>

		Books customer you are making a difference - thank you. You can be
		part of making Good Books a global force. If you like what weâ€™re
		doing, please tell people about us and keep coming back.</p><p><b>Our
		distributor: </b>To create Good Books we teamed up with international book
		distributors The Paperback Shop UK (PBS). PBS provides the 'back-end'
		of what we do: sourcing huge ranges of books (over 4 million titles
		and growing), managing distribution and negotiating delivery. PBS has
		been a major support to this project, supplying all our original web
		site programming development and management for free. </p><p><b>Our advertising
		agency: </b>String Theory is an innovative, brand-building agency
		supplying support and resources to this project. Executive Creative
		Director, Jeremy Taine is also a member of the Good Books Trust Board.
</p>
	<p>	<b>Our legal support: </b>Nhat Nguyen has provided us with sound legal
		advice and fully supported the project as it has developed.</p><p> <b>The media:</b>
		Publishers, writers and bloggers around the world have shown great
		interest in, and support for, the Good Books project without which the
		work of sharing the Good Books story would be so much more difficult.
		They are a vital and much appreciated part of what we do.</p>
